# WebApp

- Displayed below is the landing page for a fictitious Web Application developed through Django, a Python Web framework. This WebApp is still in development mode. The goal of this page is to have users search for races, from 5Ks all the way to full-marathons, and register for the one they want to participate in. Also, the idea is to allow users to communicate with other runners to share results and training regimens.
